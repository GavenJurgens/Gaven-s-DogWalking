     <h1>About Us</h1>
	 <p> We are a small-time dog walking company that is based in the city of Beatrice. Our founder was a person the loved dogs. When the business first started, they would always bring their two dogs with them when they walked the dogs. The two dogs were a pure-breed Siberian Husky named Jethro and a mixed herding dog named Finn. </p>
